# Resume Scanner
You can upload your resume and paste a job description. The application will use NLP to give you a score on how well your resume matches the job description. It will also use a custom trained NER model to extract skills from both the resume and job. Finally, it will compare them and suggest skills and keywords to add to your resume.
_Please note:_
- _The model's outputs may occasionally contain inaccuracies or unexpected results._
- _Please also run model.py to train your custom NER model if you find issue with main.py or running the uploaded model. It may take several minutes to train._
